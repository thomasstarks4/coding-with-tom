          Welcome to my portolio! I'm <em>Thomas Starks</em>, a Navy veteran and
          Full-Stack Software Engineer with over three years of experience
          building dynamic web applications and immersive 2D games. My expertise
          spans front-end development with React, JavaScript, and CSS frameworks
          like Bootstrap and Tailwind, and back-end development with C#, VB.NET,
          PHP, and SQL. I leverage tools like Postman for rigorous API testing
          and Git for seamless version control, ensuring robust and scalable
          solutions. My career is driven by a passion for solving complex
          problems and delivering user-focused experiences, honed through my
          work at IMT Insurance, Makai Watersports Rentals, and most recently at
          DataAnnotation.tech.

          At IMT Insurance, I developed a client management system that
          streamlined policy and claims processes for insurance agents. By
          implementing user-friendly React components, resolving API
          bottlenecks, and enhancing backend performance with C# and SQL Server,
          I improved system responsiveness and usability. My focus on Agile
          collaboration ensured seamless team integration, while my UI
          enhancements using Bootstrap and CSS Flexbox elevated the user
          experience. Similarly, at Makai Watersports Rentals, I designed a
          visually appealing landing page with React, SCSS, and Bootstrap, and
          optimized SQL databases with complex stored procedures to ensure data
          integrity and performance. I also integrated Formik and Yup for robust
          form validation, enhancing the frontendâ€™s reliability.
