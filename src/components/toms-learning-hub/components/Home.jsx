          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold sm:text-2xl">How It Works:</h2>
          <ul className="mt-4 space-y-4 text-sm leading-6 text-gray-700 sm:text-base">
            <li>
              <strong>Sentence Starters:</strong> We offer a wide variety of
              sentence starters that form the base of a sentence. These starters
              are crafted to be simple and meaningful, helping children
              understand the context and structure of sentences.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Common Words and Phrases:</strong> The software introduces
              children to frequently used words in a fun way, reinforcing their
              recognition and understanding. By reading these common words in
              different contexts, children can start to form their own sentences
              and improve their reading fluency.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Interactive Learning:</strong> Our program encourages
              children to interact with the content, helping them stay engaged
              and interested. The goal is to make reading not just a learning
              process but an adventure they can enjoy!
